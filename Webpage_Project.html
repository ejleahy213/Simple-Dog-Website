    <h2>Ears</h2>
      <p>
        There is almost nothing cuter than a dog's ears. From <b>big floppy
        ones</b> to <em>small bowtie</em> ears. Without their ears, every dog
        would just have an apple-shaped head. Ears give the dog it's own
        personality and unique characteristics.

  <div class="Tails">
    <h3>Tails</h3>
      <p>
        A dog's tail can be a <em>tiny stub</em> or a <b>long whip.</b> You
        can get a good sense of how a dog feels about you based on how their
        tail is wagging or wiggling.
        A tail that is pointed straight up means the dog is alert and excited.
        If the dog's tail is low and toward it's legs then the dog is
        concerned or submissive. And obviously, if the tail is wagging quickly
        the dog is super happy to see you!
      </p>

    <h4>Paws</h4>
      <p>
        A dog is nothing without it's paws! The tough, sturdy, rubbery
        texture allows a dog to walk comfortably across almost all
        surfaces. While it is impossible to find two paw prints that are
        compelely alike, dog prints are not as unique as human fingerprints.
        <br>
        However, paws do come in several different shapes and sizes.
        You could have <em>dainty little ones</em>...
      </p>
        <div class="dainty"><img class="dainty" src="images/dainty.jpeg"
          alt="dainty placeholder">
        </div>
        <div class="dainty2"><img class="dainty2" src="images/dainty2.jpeg"
          alt="dainty2 placeholder">
        </div>
        <br>
        Or you could have <b>giant muffin paws</b>...
        <div class="muffin"><img class="muffin" src="images/muffin.jpg"
          alt="muffin placeholder">
        </div>
    <h5>Snouts</h5>
      <p>
        Without snouts, a dog just wouldn't be a dog. It is commonly known
        that dogs can smell up to 100,000 times better than a human.
        More importantly, however, their noses are just about their
        cutest features!
